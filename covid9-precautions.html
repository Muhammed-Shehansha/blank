<P><FONT Size="5" Color="White">“Based on the information received so far, and on our experience with other coronaviruses, COVID-19 appears to spread mostly through respiratory droplets (when a sick person coughs, for example) and close contact,” a WHO spokesperson told Medical News Today.</P>
<P>In light of that information, the spokesperson said, the WHO recommend preventive actions to minimize exposure to droplets.</P>
<P>During day-to-day activities, people can take the following measures to prevent infection, in accordance with WHO guidelines:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Clean the hands regularly with an alcohol-based sanitizer, or wash them with soap and water. The CDC also make this recommendation, advising that sanitizer should contain “at least 60% alcohol” and that people should wash their hands for at least 20 seconds.</LI>
<LI>Clean surfaces — such as kitchen seats and work desks — regularly with disinfectant.</LI>
<LI>Avoid crowded areas when going out, for people over 60 years old and people with any underlying health problems.</LI>
<LI>Try to avoid close contact with people who display flu-like symptoms, including coughing and sneezing.</LI>
<LI>Get accurate information about COVID-19. Some good sources include the <A href="https://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=15696:coronavirus-disease-covid-19&Itemid=4206%E2%9F%A8=en&lang=en">Pan American Health Organization</A> and <A Href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public">WHO</A> websites.</LI>

<P><FONT Size="5" Color="White">Work and school environments may seem particularly daunting in the context of an outbreak, but some simple measures can help prevent infection in the office or classroom.</P>
<P>They are largely the same as those outlined above. According to WHO recommendations, the following are the most important preventive steps:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Regularly clean work surfaces and objects in continual use, such as phones and computer keyboards.</LI>
<LI>Regularly wash the hands with soap and water or use sanitizer.</LI>

<P><FONT Size="5" Color="White">For people who are planning to travel, all of the same basic hygiene recommendations apply. The WHO advise:</P>
<UL>
<LI>cleaning hands on a regular basis</LI>
<LI>keeping at least 1 meter’s distance from people who are coughing or sneezing</LI>
<LI>following COVID-19-specific travel advisories from local authorities</LI>

<P><FONT Size="5" Color="White">What happens if you start experiencing flu-like symptoms despite your best attempts to stay healthy?</P>
<P>The WHO spokesperson who responded to MNT queries offered the following advice:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Cough or sneeze into your elbow or use a tissue, then dispose of the tissue immediately and clean your hands.</LI>
<LI>If you feel unwell, stay home and call your doctor or a local health professional.</LI>
<LI>If you develop shortness of breath, call your doctor and seek care immediately.</LI>
<LI>If you are sick: Stay home, eat and sleep separately from others in the house, and use different utensils and cutlery.</LI>
</OL>
<P>The WHO spokesperson also gave us some travel-related advice for people who have flu-like symptoms and are either contemplating travel or have just returned from a trip.</p>
<P>They explained that:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Anyone with a fever or cough should avoid traveling.</LI>
<LI>Anyone who develops symptoms on a flight should inform the crew immediately and, once home, contact a health professional and tell them about the locations visited.</LI>

<P><FONT Size="5" Color="White">What if you develop COVID-19, or a healthcare professional suspects that you have it, and you need to stay home for a prolonged period? How should you prepare? Some public health experts have offered advice.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>“If you or a friend or family member takes any prescription medication, make sure you have a good supply, e.g., at least 4 weeks’ worth,” says Prof. Peter Openshaw, from Imperial College London, in the United Kingdom.</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>As for food and other necessities, “Don’t panic buy,” he advises, “but do buy a few extra provisions when you normally go shopping. Don’t forget about pets.”</P>
